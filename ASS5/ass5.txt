Kernel Prediction with medians

2. Smaller bandwidths lines are more exact as they are closer to the actual data points, for that particular dataset. Larger bandwdiths lines are further away and give a less accurate detail however they can be used on various datasets and give similar predictions.
A higher bandwidth is better for prediction on various datasets, a smaller bandwidth is better for a single dataset.

The shape plotted changes in that the waiting times seem to go down and not have a lot of range. Therefore the eruptions appear to happen closer to each other, meaning less waiting time between eruptions. However compared to the original data, there is a lot more varability in waiting time. It's important to note the overall the scatterplots have the same shape regardless of the different values of k that range from 5% to 40%. Meaning the data is pretty consistant regardless of how small the data set is, eruptions that are longer tend to have longer waiting times.
