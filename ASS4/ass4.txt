Regression & Association Rules

1. I used linear regression to predict how the weight will effect the miles per gallon. The slope in my graph comparing mpg to weight, corresponds to the predictor variable, weight, by showing a downwards slope. The interpretation of this means as the weight of vehicle gets larger the mpg gets lower. If I were to explain the significance of this finding to someone, I would suggest to them that if they were to purchase a larger vehicle then they may have to consider spending more money on gas, since the miles per gallon or in other words, distance that they would get, would potentially be lower than when compared to a lighter sized vehicle.

When you change to the logarithm of mileage and compare the results to the previous results we see no difference in terms of plots scattered.

both graphs? Ask if code is correct and what it means as to why its the same?

3. 
three graphs?

4.
The results of the logarithm of lp100km with the logarithm of mpg is perfectly linear. Meaning there is no difference between x and y, lPer100km and mpg, making the slope -1.000e+00 and intercept to 5.460e+00.

# Missing Items & association rules

5.
// is number 5 a question in itself or something to keep in mind when answering a-c?
a. 
1/4 is the support of A=>B. 
1/2 is the confidence of A=>B.
(1/2)/(2/4) is the lift of A=>B. Meaning that lift is 1 and therefore A and B are to independant occurances and we cannot say that A influences the apparence of B in any way.

b. 
The support: 1 / 5
confidence: 1 / 3
lift: (1 / 3) / (2 / 5) is 0.83 meaning that theres a chance that A influences the appearence of B in that if A is present then B most likely will not be present with it.
//ask if correct? pretend like deleted value is 0

c. support: 2 / 5
confidence: 2 / 3
lift: (2 / 3) / (3 / 5) is 1.1 meaning that A does influence the appearence of B in that if A does appear there is a higher chance that B will appear with it.
// ask if he means B is also .4? so pretend like it is 1

# Congressional Voting

6.
The missing values from the UCI webpage are due to "voted present"", "voted present to avoid conflict of interest"", and "did not vote or otherwise make a position known". This can happen for example if the voter may not have been informed fully about the topic or they may have a conflict of interest (n.a., 2019). 

In this dataset an missing value is given a '?' as a value in the table. Azevedo et al. state that there are two ways to deal with missing data, one way is to delete incomplete observations entirely. Another way is to replace any missing values with an estimated guessed value based on previous data. However both these ways effect the conclusions that can be gathered from the data. 

In my opinion on what should be done in this case, since each vote is tied to an individual person, I believe it is best to delete the entire blank value. We cannot give a value to that specific person, because it would indicate we have voted for them without their approval.
