Mortality

Question 1 Explain what generally happens to child mortality over time. Support your statement with a suitable, well-labeled plot.

The child mortality rates have lowered greatly from 1800 until 2015. This means children are generally living longer than before.


Question 2 For the year 1800, create a table like the one above and calculate the average life expectancy from the probability distribution.

The average life expectancy is 40.556.



Question 3 Use the formula above and either with math or a table of values (not both), justify what happens to life expectancy over time.

Life expectancy over time increases as the portion of the population that died at age 2, decreases.

Question 4


Lung Capacity

Question 5 Use the data provided to explain the relationship you see between lung function and smoking. Support your conclusion with tables and/or graphs. This answer should be about a page.
