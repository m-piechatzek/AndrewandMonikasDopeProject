The child mortality rates have lowered greatly from 1800 until 2015. This means children are generally living longer than before.

Question 3 Use the formula above and either with math or a table of values (not both), justify what happens to life expectancy over time.


Lung Capacity

Question 5 Use the data provided to explain the relationship you see between lung function and smoking. Support your conclusion with tables and/or graphs. This answer should be about a page.
